                        The UofC Healthcare Enthusiasts club is a student club founded in 2022 that aims to connect like minded undergraduate students at the University of Calgary who aspire to pursue a career in healthcare. The variety of possible fields to explore are endless and include, but are not limited to: nursing, pharmacology, biotechnology, paramedicine, medical genetics, various fields in medicine, and more. We host a variety of events each year to provide students with the opportunity to connect with various health professionals and network with other students. Some of our past events include a suturing lab, bioethics debate, research panel, and more. Our ongoing initiatives for this year will be focused on our healthcare professions webseries and our Healthcare Enthusiasts Mentorship Program.
